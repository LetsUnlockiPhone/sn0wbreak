* automatic device detection for booting is done
* simple gui too
* but jailbreaking is still 2 do
-----------------------------------
my goal:
* an "official" jb, so that it's supported on jbqa.me
* a opensource jb, with a nice gui
* failsafe
* a credits list that's *very* long (hehehehe)
------------------------------------
todo: add the makers of p0sixspwn to the credits list, for the Cydia.tar that i use from there...
