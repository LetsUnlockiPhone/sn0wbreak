INSTRUCTIONS:

- Backup your device using iTunes (or iCloud) before using sn0wbreak.
- Please disable the lock passcode of your iOS device before using evasi0n. It can cause issues.
- Open sn0wbreak, plug in your device, and click "Identify device and fix dependancies". When that is done, click "Jailbreak". Stay with your computer and watch for any steps you may be asked to perform.
- Avoid all iOS and iTunes related tasks until evasi0n is complete. Why not just enjoy a brief break from the computer to stretch your legs?
- If the process gets stuck somewhere, it's safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home until it shuts down), and re-run the process.
- If you get an error on OS X 10.8 / 10.9 saying that evasi0n can't be opened, control-click (or right-click) the app and on the revealed context menu, choose 'Open.' On the ensuing dialogue box, choose 'Open' as well.
- Some Cydia tweaks are not yet compatible with iOS 7.1.x. The situation will improve as developers will update their software.
