This patch is the only real change i've done to opensn0w, to the github version when compiling it, but the prebuilt version if from an older commit as far as i know, not sure :

http://devbug.me/attachment/4174303333.zip

I manually added the files:
bundles/iPhone3,1_7.1.1_11D201.plist
bundles/iPhone3,2_7.1.1_11D201.plist
budnles/iPhone3,3_7.1.1_11D201.plist

to the bundles folder of the compiled version.
